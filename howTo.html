		<h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
		<div id="how">At the top of the screen are three aspects of citizen life: health, welfare, and happiness. Every round there is a problem that you, the mayor of the city, must solve by answering yes or no. Depending on your choices, the three elements will fluctuate. Your goal is to keep all three elements above zero. This will ensure that the city flourishes, and the game will be won. Otherwise, your citizens will overthrow you and your city will fall into ruin.</div>
